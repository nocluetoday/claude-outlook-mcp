## Usage

Once installed, you can use the Outlook tool directly from Claude by asking questions like:

- "Can you check my unread emails in Outlook?"
- "Search my Outlook emails for the quarterly report"
- "Send an email to john@example.com with the subject 'Meeting Tomorrow'"
- "What's on my calendar today?"
- "Create a meeting for tomorrow at 2pm"
- "Find the contact information for Jane Smith"

## Examples

### Email Operations

```
Check my unread emails in Outlook
```

```
Send an email to alex@example.com with subject "Project Update" and the following body: Here's the latest update on our project. We've completed phase 1 and are moving on to phase 2.
```

```
Send an HTML email to team@example.com with subject "Weekly Report" and attach the quarterly_results.pdf file
```

```
Search my emails for "budget meeting"
```

### Calendar Operations

```
What events do I have today?
```

```
Create a calendar event for a team meeting tomorrow from 2pm to 3pm
```

```
Show me my upcoming events for the next 2 weeks
```

### Contact Operations

```
List all my Outlook contacts
```

```
Search for contact information for Jane Smith
```

## Advanced Features

### HTML Email Support

You can send rich HTML-formatted emails by setting the `isHtml` parameter to true:

```
Send an HTML email to john@example.com with the subject "Project Update" and body "<h1>Project Update</h1><p>We've made <b>significant progress</b> on the project.</p>"
```

### File Attachments

You can attach files to your emails by providing the file paths in the `attachments` parameter:

```
Send an email to jane@example.com with subject "Monthly Report" and attach the reports/march_2025.pdf file
```

For best results with attachments:
- Use absolute file paths when possible
- Make sure the files are accessible to the process running the MCP tool
- Attachments will automatically be handled with robust error detection

#### Attachment Security Controls

Attachments are restricted to reduce accidental data exfiltration:

- `ALLOWED_ATTACHMENT_ROOTS` (optional): colon-separated list of allowed root directories. Defaults to the current working directory if unset.
- `MAX_ATTACHMENT_BYTES` (optional): maximum allowed file size in bytes. Defaults to 10 MB.

Example:

```bash
export ALLOWED_ATTACHMENT_ROOTS="/Users/YOURUSERNAME/Documents:/Users/YOURUSERNAME/Downloads"
export MAX_ATTACHMENT_BYTES=10485760
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with attachments:
- Check if the file exists and is readable
- Use absolute file paths instead of relative paths
- Make sure the user running the process has permission to read the file

If you encounter the error `Cannot find module '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/index.js'`:

1. Make sure you've run `bun install` to install all dependencies
2. Try installing the MCP SDK explicitly:
   ```bash
   bun add @modelcontextprotocol/sdk@^1.5.0
   ```
3. Check if the module exists in your node_modules directory:
   ```bash
   ls -la node_modules/@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/
   ```

If the error persists, try creating a new project with Bun:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/yourpath/claude-outlook-mcp
cd ~/yourpath/claude-outlook-mcp
bun init -y
```

Then copy the package.json and index.ts files to the new directory and run:

```bash
bun install
bun run index.ts
```

Update your claude_desktop_config.json to point to the new location.
